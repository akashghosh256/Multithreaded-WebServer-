# Multithreaded Server Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of single-threaded, multi-threaded, and thread-pool servers in Java, along with performance testing using JMeter.

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of different server architectures to handle concurrent client requests efficiently. It includes:

- **Single-threaded server**: Handles client requests sequentially, one at a time.
- **Multi-threaded server**: Creates a new thread for each client connection, allowing multiple clients to be served simultaneously.
- **Thread pool server**: Utilizes a fixed-size thread pool to manage client connections efficiently, avoiding the overhead of creating new threads for each request.

Additionally, performance testing is conducted using JMeter to evaluate the scalability and throughput of each server implementation.

## Features

- Implementation of single-threaded, multi-threaded, and thread-pool servers.
- Efficient handling of concurrent client connections.
- Performance testing using JMeter to assess server scalability and throughput.
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JMeter
